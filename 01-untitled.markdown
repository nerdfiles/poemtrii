    I own the streets
    He owns the road
    
    Cats in despair,
    Structs and the echo of
    Anything carefully assessed, or
    The minute sense of sensing, helpfully
    Guiding us there, betwixt networks so echoliac,
    The lylac and idyllic contempible swagger
    That generates all together fibers ecolackkkking
    Egotistical regions, sub stories, which bathe, integrate,,,
    However quizzacally in the natural world. Indeed, such a beginning
    remains doubtless a curiosity, that the world rendered may weave 
    into one numerically unbounded. Countless beginnings occur within
    the world of logic. Transformations, rendered as _modus ponens_, 
    codify a wealthy store of historic symbols:

      (_a list of awkward, pedophilic greek terms and a disarray of 
      houses_)

    Why _those_ symbols? Why should _we_ perceive _those_ symbols? As
    the machinations of logic churn mechanically, the notion of a 
    template imbibes of content. As a slice, intersections of canoni-
    cal forms emerge inevitably, through the diagonalization method
    itself being representable within its constitution.
