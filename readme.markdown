#Poemtrii

A collection of poems from out of nowhere.

##Students

1. Aharon Alexander ([nerdfiles@gmail.com](nerdfiles@gmail.com))

##Constraints

A significant number of these poems shall be express'd with the dyslexic-notational _typeface_ [AlphaSymbolic](https://github.com/antijingoist/AlphaSymbolic), render'd by [Abelard Gonzales](http://abbiecod.es/). (I am sure other faces could be algorithmically generated such that a general _font_ library may be draft'd.) For the most part this repository will play out as a linguistic exercise area for learning the notational font, in hope that it shall become quickly master'd. 

###Note

Thus, poems rendered without uppercase glyths likely were written in AlphaSymbolic.

##Natural Languages

As a step beyond our constraints or, that is, the rules of this game, after having mastere'd the notational font, or as some put it: its own _language_, a strategy should be develop'd and standardized toward the mastery of all Latin-based natural languages.

###Language Storage

Study materials shall be collected onto Dropbox: [https://www.dropbox.com/sh/sscph5xpshvwttc/IPJB1a7bsU/Languages](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/sscph5xpshvwttc/IPJB1a7bsU/Languages)

##Essential Reading

1. [Dyslexic Notation](http://infosthetics.com/archives/2012/07/dyslexic_notation.html).
2. [What's Whole in Whole Language?](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2694061-what-s-whole-in-whole-language).
	1. The idea here is that the "stress" of AlphaSymbolic is manifest in "chunks" of text, and it seems that a standard of "graphemological" evaluation may be developed using AlphaSymbolic which reliably informs our understanding of what constitutes "whole" language types.
3. Wikipedia on [Ken Goodman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Goodman).
4. [Philosophical Investigations](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12073.Philosophical_Investigations).
5. Richard Hare's [The Language of Morals](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1633664.The_Language_of_Morals).
	1. For a thorough-going development of a strategy to address George Edward Moore's "naturalistic fallacy" as it relates to the displacement of meaning of hypothetical and categorical imperatives as they relate to pretheoretical moral predication.
6. Any judiciously revelatory course in descriptivist linguistics, or the [language log](http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/).
7. For kicks and propserity: Noam Chomsky's [Syntactic Structures]().

##Other Debris

1. Lexical Functional Grammars.
2. Finite-state Morphological Grammars.
3. Natural Language Processing.

##Recent applications
