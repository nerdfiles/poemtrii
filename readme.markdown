#Poemtrii

A collection of poems from out of nowhere.

##Students

1. Aharon Alexander ([nerdfiles@gmail.com](nerdfiles@gmail.com))

##Constraints

A significant number of these poems shall be express'd with the dyslexic-notational _typeface_ [AlphaSymbolic](https://github.com/antijingoist/AlphaSymbolic), render'd by [Abelardo Gonzales](http://abbiecod.es/). (I am sure other faces could be algorithmically generated such that a general _font_ library may be draft'd.) For the most part this repository will play out as a linguistic exercise area for learning the notational typeface, in hope that it shall become quickly master'd. 

"The basis for our creative effort was the metaphor that dyslexics view characters as three-dimensional shapes. This way our characters seem to have an organic stature
to them. The English language is almost fifty percent redundant with the typeface we carried that redundancy over to the letter itself so that even if confusion does occur that characters are still easily distinguished."
â€” "Dyslexic Notation: Combining Aesthetics and Scientific Notation to Combat Dyslexia", Geraid Morin & Kanny Yeung

###Note

Thus, poems rendered without uppercase glyths likely were written in AlphaSymbolic.

##Natural languages

As a step beyond our constraints or, that is, the rules of this game, after having master'd the notational typeface, or as some put it: its own _language_, a strategy should be develop'd and standardized toward the mastery of all Latin-based natural languages.

###Language storage

Study materials shall be collected onto Dropbox: [https://www.dropbox.com/sh/sscph5xpshvwttc/IPJB1a7bsU/Languages](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/sscph5xpshvwttc/IPJB1a7bsU/Languages)

1. French

3. [And so on](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_languages)...

##Essential reading

1. [Dyslexic Notation](http://infosthetics.com/archives/2012/07/dyslexic_notation.html).
2. [What's Whole in Whole Language?](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2694061-what-s-whole-in-whole-language).
	1. The idea here is that the "stress" of AlphaSymbolic is manifest in "chunks" of text, and it seems that a standard of "graphemological" evaluation may be developed using AlphaSymbolic which reliably informs our understanding of what constitutes "whole" language types.
3. Wikipedia on [Ken Goodman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Goodman).
4. [Philosophical Investigations](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12073.Philosophical_Investigations).
5. Richard Hare's [The Language of Morals](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1633664.The_Language_of_Morals).
	1. For a thorough-going development of a strategy to address George Edward Moore's "naturalistic fallacy" as it relates to the displacement of meaning of hypothetical and categorical imperatives as they relate to pretheoretical moral predication.
6. Any judiciously revelatory course in descriptivist linguistics, or the [language log](http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/).
7. For kicks and propserity: Noam Chomsky's [Syntactic Structures]().

##Some inspiration

Originally I had the idea of using AlphaSymbolic as a pictographic mapping system. So, users would be expected to 
choose morphemes or phrases from presentation-sets which most intuitively speak to them, based on presented typesettings 
with, say, a candidate "situation" or "imagine" for which those terms are most representative. I want for people to learn 
AlphaSymbolic; but most importantly, for people not to be taken aback at the sight of others *reading* in AlphaSymbolic.

###AlphaSymbolic's "glyphobet", if you will:

From antijingoist's highly usable, practical [rendering](http://antijingoist.github.com/AlphaSymbolic/) of the typeface.

###A use-case scenario, or a "killer app," I reckon (fund me now, dammit)

Imagine:

| WordInAlphaSymbolic* | WordInDyslexicFont | WordInSerifFont | WordInSansSerifFont |

The user chooses the morphological or graphemological construct which most speaks to the them. The hypothesis here, 
essentially, is that all typefaces (applied fonts under a particular use-case) carry metainformation (on top of 
being about a topic). The goal would be to acclimate the user to a new typeface (ideally, AlphaSymbolic). However, 
this method could readily be used for A26 or even Blissymbols.

###Requirements

However, now my project has been given certain concrete inspiration from the aforementioned Web applications which primarily 
aim at teaching coders how to better acquaint themeselves with alternative paradigms of coding and languages, in general. 
My project now will consist of a (still "Whole") language acquisition app, but furthermore:

1. [Syzygy](http://journal.webscience.org/491/) search the Web for ideal-phrase candidates (linguistic constructs which conform to Whole language teaching practices) from an array of languages.
2. Intuitively accept as input, that said, hypernyms, undernyms, synonyms, vernacularisms, idiomatic alternatives for morphological units.
3. Present alternative typesettings, including notational fonts and dyslexic fonts (like AlphaSymbolic and OpenDyslexic).
4. Have an Easter egg where the scales of music are present for piano.

###The "Pitch"

For those of the MBA mentality:

    Allow the users to type out AlphaSymbolic* over conventional/ideal candidate phrases from an initial starting language.
