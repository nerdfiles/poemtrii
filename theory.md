# Theory

To the considerate. We toil over the superfluity of our ideas, only grasping 
at the odds and ends of material significance of the Other. Our thoughts 
when sewn together compose the distinct purpose of multiple realization. A 
thought is a composition of disjoint extractions, put up into the holiness 
of bank notes, microtransactions, and instability.

The considerate maintain the moral code of the presentation of culture. The 
eyes of the considerate do not possess any capability outside of the possible. 
The bodily work of presentation is a wholeness untoward any immaculate 
conception. Yet the proof of presentation holds unanimously throughout the 
strings of material significance.

A book codifies the language of language, and tells a culture the nominal 
significance of preset or fashionable intellectual validity. A soup of books 
might demolish any ecosystem of pretension; and the principle of genetic 
nomenclature may demonstrate the future act of deconstruction.

A linguistic arbitrage swerves relentlessly through the whole power structure 
of a given culture’s portending verbs or happy circumstances of thankless 
harbingers. No thought inwardly escapes the intellectual validity of present 
compossibility. Understandable is the series of grieves, yet the action of 
pedestrian gnosis yields a militancy which bathes in the hopelessness of 
absolute structure. The harrowing calamity of normalized marketeers roams in 
the banality of evil — the systemic onslaught of negligence.

The unforgiving rule the day. A canister of demons betroth the happiness of 
the masses. A seller of crystals might understand the last reflection of a 
dying theoretical limit. Some echo of the demonic witch hunt screams into 
an epoch: the militancy is nowhere else but within.
